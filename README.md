# MTSTRec: Multimodal Time-Aligned Shared Token Recommender 
The **Multimodal Time-Aligned Shared Token Recommender (MTSTRec)** is a transformer-based model designed for sequential recommendation in e-commerce. Unlike traditional methods that fuse multimodal data (e.g., text, images, and pricing) early or late, MTSTRec introduces a time-aligned shared token for each product. This token enables efficient cross-modal fusion while maintaining temporal alignment in usersâ€™ browsing sequences. By capturing rich, modality-specific features and aligning them in time, MTSTRec offers a more comprehensive understanding of user preferences. Experiments show that MTSTRec outperforms existing multimodal approaches, setting new benchmarks for sequential recommendation performance.
